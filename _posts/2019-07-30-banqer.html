			This conference package was created from the ground up by myself and Emma Martin. With Emma spearheading the branding, while I took lead on web, animation, and project management.

			The NZ Kiwi Ruby conference is held once every two years with ruby developers converging on Wellington from all over Australasia. Working with the Kiwi Ruby team we set forth to deliver an experience that would be inviting, fresh, informative, and fun.

			Hand-crafted giant rubies were placed on stage and at the entry to the conference. Designed to be playful, their scale and colour lifted the simple black backdrop and brought the stage to life.
		</p>
		<p class="t-light t-c-grey t-fs-xs-1 t-lh-xs-3 mt-0 mb-10">
			In addition to the rubies we were able to utilise an animated podium to further integrate the branding, this screen provided the speakers name and twitter handle to help attendees interact.

			With the days events locked in the Kiwi Ruby smart schedule made finding what was up next an easy task. As events moved into the past they would take on a grey shade, the page automatically snapping to the current time.

			The information was treated with respect, giving prominent positioning to the times, while font weight and colour were used to emphasise titles and the current speaker.
