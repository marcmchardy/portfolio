			There isn't much real estate on a mascara or lipstick box but we made it work. Two sides dedicated to the brand and product name, with an embossed logo, and two sides dedicated to the boring business stuff - I lie, it's actually really interesting! i&i produce 100% vegan, cruelty free make-up that includes no nasty ingredients!

			Branding on the lipstick was kept to a simple logo across the body and lid, the soft muted pink carrying across from the packaging.

			Accompanying stickers were designed to go with each of the lipsticks being produced. A simple left-aligned template keeps the product readable and consistent.
