			The challenge here was to communicate with students their check-in status, how many check-ins are required per day and week, as well as when they will level up in their career. There are a lot of moving parts and this did take some refinement before we hit the sweet spot. The check-in table has been modelled off popular fitness trackers and easily expands as a student levels up and gains more check-in opportunities.
